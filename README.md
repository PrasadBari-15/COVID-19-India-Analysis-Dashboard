## 🧩 Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on India’s healthcare system, economy, and society.  
This project analyzes **India’s COVID-19 journey** by studying confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, testing, and vaccination progress.

An **interactive Power BI dashboard** is built to visualize trends over time, compare state-wise performance, and understand the impact of vaccination.  
Missing data for later years is handled using **logical guesstimation techniques**.
